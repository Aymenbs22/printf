.SH DESCREPTION
"_printf" is the name of one of the main C output functions,
and stands for "print formatted". printf format strings are complementary to scanf format strings,
which provide formatted input (parsing). ... The format string itself is very often a string literal,
which allows static analysis of the function call.
